# Sphinx_rst2pdf_configuration
Some scripts and files described my local Python Sphinx configuratinon for genetaring Blender documentation with cs translation.
This is my 1st repository during my life than I am clicking and typing slowly.
Do not take it so seriously cause I will learn on it.
My plan is to create second repo for public files - bledner documentation with translation into Czech languge (po-mo files).

See stepbystep.batch file with echoing each step from the building process.

Rst2pdf, Sphinx, Python and others are in neigbourhood. File stepbystep.bat and source/conf.py are keys for html+pdf compilation.
Installation is principal with no special changes. Default parametres. Python 2.7 and other modules via 'pip install sphinx' 
and 'pip install rst2pdf'.
All other modification of configuration are here. E.g. only specific file from text source directory (conf.py) and working batch file make.bat.
