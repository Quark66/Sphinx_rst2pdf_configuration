# Sphinx_rst2pdf_configuration
Some scripts and files described my local Python Sphinx configuratinon for genetaring Blender documentation with cs translation.
This is my 1st repository during my life than I am clicking and typing slowly.
Do not take it so seriously cause I will learn on it.
My plan is to create second repo for public files - bledner documentation with translation into Czech languge (po-mo files).
